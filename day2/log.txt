1. Tips to keep CSS organized: 
    a. Always use a CSS preprocessor (Eg. Scss)
    b. Write HTML before CSS.
    c. Organize components using BEM model.
        - Block: 
            Represents a standalone component that is meaningful on its own.
        - Element:
            A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.
        - Modifier:
            A flag on a block or element. Use it to change appearance, behavior, or state.
    d. Don’t reference IDs in the CSS.
    e. Use Github’s CSS guidelines.
    f. Avoid using !important at all costs.
        - Breaks CSS specificity rules – It overrides all other styles, making debugging harder.

        - Hard to maintain – You or others may struggle to figure out why a rule is being applied.

        - Encourages bad practices – Often used to "quick-fix" issues instead of solving them properly.

        - Makes overrides harder – If you use !important, someone else may have to use another !important just to override it.
    g. Use bootstrap only when needed, (make sure you understand it before using it).
    h. Keep your HTML simple and readable.

        initial	- Sets this property to its default value. 
        inherit - Inherits this property from its parent element.
    
    c. font-weight:
        normal, bold, medium, 100, 200, ... 900 etc.
    
    d. font- variant: 
        normal: normal

3. Webfonts:
