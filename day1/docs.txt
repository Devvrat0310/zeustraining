    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>

    </body>
    </html>

Topic 2: CSS
Question 1: Explain the different ways in which CSS can be applied to HTML, what is the preferred way and why. 

There are three ways to apply CSS on an HTML file: 
    1. Inline css:
        This is added directly inside html tag using "style" attribute

    2. Internal css:
        In this, styles are written inside a <style> tag in <head> tag within the same HTML file.
    
    3. External CSS
        Written in a separate .css file and linked using <link> tag.

External CSS is preferred due to following reasons:
    - Easier to read and understand.
    - Easier to maintain and update styles across multiple pages
    - We can reuse the styles for consistent design

Different CSS Selectors: 
Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type.

Class Selector: Targets all elements with a specific class attribute.

ID Selector: Targets one unique element with a specific id attribute.

    1. Inline css:
        Adding JavaScript code directly inside an HTML element using the onclick, onload, or other event attributes

    2. Internal css:
        Writing JavaScript code inside a <script> tag within the HTML document, usually inside the <head> or at the end of the <body>.

    3. External CSS
        Linking an external .js file using the <script> tag with the src attribute.
